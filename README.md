# Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++ using the GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) library for graphics. The game provides a classic gaming experience where players control a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat the randomly positioned food items to increase the snake's length. Players can control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
